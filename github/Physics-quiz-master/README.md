# Physics-quiz

Physics-quiz is a mini-project that can use for brush upon the fundamental oberservation and knowledge of some important physics experiments perfomed by famous scientists.
Here we have 10 tests on the topics

- To determine the specific resistance of a given wire by Carey Foster’s Bridge
- To determine the wavelength of monochromatic sodium light by using Newton's rings.
- To verify Stefan’s Law by electrical method
- To determine the electrochemical equivalent of copper using a Tangent galvanometer (TG)
- To Measurement of Numerical Aperture (N.A.) of Optical Fibre
- To determine the energy band gap of a given semiconductor material.
- To study the variation of magnetic field with distance along the axis of current carrying coil and then to estimate the radius of the coil.
- To determine the specific rotation of an optical active solution by polarimeter.
- To determine the focal length of the combination of two lenses by nodal slide and locate the position of cardinal points.
- To determine the wavelength of spectral lines using plane transmission grating
